We also examine how attrition varies across job roles, departments, income levels, performance, and overtime.<br>
Analyze salary trends to promote fair compensation.<br>
Plus, we dig into employee well-being by reviewing satisfaction at work and in relationships, job involvement, and salary increases.<br>
